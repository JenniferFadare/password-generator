## Password Generator Challenge
Module 3 assignment

## Purpose
Randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Built With:

* Java Script
* HTML
* CSS

## Website

https://jenniferfadare.github.io/password-generator/ 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password

- [X] WHEN I click the button to generate a password THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

- [X] WHEN prompted for password criteria THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

    The user is asked to select 'ok' if they want the feature and 'cancel' if they don't.

- [X] WHEN prompted for the length of the password THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

- [X] WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

- [X] WHEN I answer each prompt THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

- [X] WHEN all prompts are answered THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

    This was the hardest part of the challenge and took me a while to understand that I was thinking about it too hard.  I achieved this part by creating a character bank and concatonating the possible word banks together, then using the random number feature to pick the position in the character bank array.

- [X] WHEN the password is generated THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
